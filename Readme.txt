Dear Prof.

To get the project build, use:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make

This will get a wrapper lib and the homework project build.
Like before, the utilities I included are a still bit overkill.
The reason is that I'm also trying to practice my C++ skill
in addition of finishing the homework.

It turns out that a lot of my toy codes are not that applicable to
this course (LuaConfig class to read external .lua object files,
a Timer class support pause/resume operation, strong-typed template 
Uniform/BufferObject class, and RAII wrapper for other openGL handles)
So if you find these classes useless, just ignore them, and focus 
on the homework part. :)

P.S. Arcball is now supported, you can drag around.

Sincerely,
Weizhe Yuan
